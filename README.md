Project to share translations of rhymit

The portuguese and english translations are quite good I guess, maybe spanish is also okay because it's similarities with portuguese.

But the other languages outside these languages I made the dictionary without knowing a lot about the target languages so feel free to improve.

So feel free to improve, I plan to launch a new rhymit release with better functionalities about every 3 months, so if you use the app and contribute here will not take long for you to feel the improvement in the app :)
